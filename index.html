            <p>I moved to Los Angeles ~3.5 years and it has been quite the journey. Originally from the East Coast, I
                graduated from NYU with a BSME. I worked for General Dynamics Electric Boat as a Ship Systems Engineer
                II
                in the
                Habitibility & Life Support Systems Group of the VIRGINIA Class Program. Upon moving to LA, I
                transitioned from
                engineering and into Project Management.</p>
            <p>Since coming to California, I have worked on several contruction projects; USC The Village
                Project
                and LAX Terminal Redevelopment Project (T7 & T8). Today, I work at Lendlease Construction (US) as an
                Assistant Project Manager on the Oceanwide Plaza Project.</p>
            <p>I have decided to commit to the Coding Bootcamp because I want to make a change in my life. I have always
                had
                an interest in coding but need
                a structured course to commit to.</p>
            <p>Outside of work I enjoy rock climbing, skateboarding, hiking & backpacking.</p>
